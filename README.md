# Echocardiogram demand simulation
A collection of modules which implement a discrete event simulation the diagnosis pathway for patients with potential chronic heart failure. 

## Authors and acknowledgment
The code was primarily written by Alan Wise, Alex Heib and Salvador Catsis. Significant contributions have been made by Dr. Lucy Morgan, Prof. Christine Currie, Prof. Alan Champeneys and Dr. Ramesh Nadarajah. We would like to acknowledge the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust for providing patient data to enable us to parameterise the model and the Virtual Forum-Knowledge Exchange in Mathematics for technical and financial assistance.
